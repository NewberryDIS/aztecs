<h1 class="caps section section-3"><!--SECTION 3: -->Christianizing
the Nahua</h1>

<p>Religious conversion, in the eyes of the Spanish colonizers,
was an effective means of achieving political stability within the
newly acquired colonial territory. To attain this goal, the
missionaries engaged in evangelizing indigenous people in Mexico
undertook the task of making the Christian message available in the
native languages. In order to succeed, the friars also needed in-depth
knowledge about the culture and religion of the Nahuas.</p>

<p>The key strategy for conversion was to educate the sons of the
nobility using the model of the indigenous schools (<em>calmecac</em>).
In the new schools, children were separated from their families,
educated, and brought up to become the future Christian leaders of
their own communities. This system created an indigenous elite who
participated in a monumental effort to study the culture and language
of the Aztecs. This elite was also responsible for the creation of a
Nahua literary tradition; that is, an indigenous tradition fashioned
and transmitted through alphabetic writing.</p>

<p>Antonio Nebrija&rsquo;s <em>Grammar and Dictionary</em>
was the first systematic study of the Spanish language. His
methodology, derived from scholarly studies of Latin, provided a
linguistic model that Spanish missionaries applied to the study of
indigenous languages and utilized when creating an alphabetic version
of Nahuatl.</p>

<p>This handwritten copy of Nebrija&rsquo;s printed
dictionary is trilingual&mdash;Nahuatl (in red ink) has been added
to the original Spanish and Latin. Although the author is not
identified by name, he is believed to be a native Nahuatl speaker.
Scholar Mary L. Clayton finds evidence of this in the way that the
author translated certain Spanish language expressions and phrases.
Indigenous authorship indicates that this manuscript dictionary was for
use by other Nahuatl speakers, not by native Spanish speakers.</p>

<p>The friars used the study and alphabetization of Nahuatl to
find ways to appropriately communicate the Christian message.
Linguistic and cultural differences, major obstacles in the process of
evangelization, allowed the Nahuas some flexibility to shape Christian
beliefs and practices to suit their religious needs and cultural
traditions.</p>

<p>The Spanish missionaries relied on the indigenous elite to
collaborate on the translation of the Christian tradition and to
control indigenous religiosity. The choice of the form of Nahuatl
spoken by the nobility as the literary language for indigenous
education and evangelization was, as Molina reveals, a conscious agenda
on the part of the friars.</p>

<p>Father Alonso de Molina&rsquo;s <em>Arte de la
lengua</em> played a key role in the standardization of classical
Nahuatl as the language of Nahua Christianity.</p>

<p>The Catholic practice of confession had strong parallels with
the indigenous practice of <em>neiolmelaoaliztli</em>, a
cleansing ritual that involved recitation of transgressions,
self-sacrifice, and offerings to the goddess of filth, Tlazoteotl. This
posed a great challenge for the friars who needed to clarify
distinctions between the two. However, it was nearly impossible to
avoid confusions of this sort when teaching Christian doctrine and
practice. In the end, many friars ignored the religious meanings
implied in indigenous religious practices.</p>

<p>Father Molina&rsquo;s <em>Confesionario breve</em>
shows how writing a Nahuatl-language confessionary was a subtle art
involving both linguistic translation and cultural interpretation.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church was deeply disturbed by efforts to
translate the Bible into vernacular languages. Saint Jerome&rsquo;s
Latin translation, the Vulgate (406), was the official version of the
Bible for Roman Catholics. After the Council of Trent (1545-1563), the
Church, anxious to maintain the authority of the Vulgate as the only
source of the divine word, regarded versions of the Bible in the
readers&rsquo; languages a dangerous threat.</p>

<p>Missionaries nonetheless needed their audience to understand
the message. Along with sermons, Nahuatl Bible translations became a
powerful and singular expression of indigenous Christianity. The <em>Epistolae
et Evangelia</em> is a compilation of selected passages from the
Bible translated into Nahuatl for Sunday readings and special church
holidays.</p>

<p>The missionary friars feared misinterpretation of the
Christian doctrine among new converts, whom they regarded as not truly
committed to Catholicism. Responding to this concern, Friar
Sahag&uacute;n added an appendix to the collection of his doctrinal
writings, in which he included admonitions specifically warning the
Indians against some of their traditional beliefs.</p>

belief that the tears and the penitence of children can gratify <em>Titlacahuan</em>,
the <em>tloque naoaque</em> (the Lord of the Close and the
Near, an indigenous idea of &ldquo;supreme being&rdquo;

learned indigenous noblemen in the small town of Tepeapulco. The elders
showed him a variety of pictorial documents when answering his

continued to be in great demand in sixteenth-century Mexico. In these
paintings, rectangular panels of green maguey cactus fiber and white
cotton show the featherworking process. The high status of these
