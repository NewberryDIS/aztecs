<h1 class="caps section section-1"><!--SECTION 1: -->The
Pictorial Books of the Aztecs</h1>

<p>The books of the Aztecs were entirely pictorial. Events,
actions, dates, names, and ideas were all conveyed through
conventionalized images. Pictograms resembled or were visually
associated with the ideas, things, or actions represented (house, tree,
movement). Ideograms conveyed larger concepts (town, year, day).
Logograms were word-based images. This image-based system was a
composite and flexible one in which pictograms, ideograms and logograms
might all be combined in a single image. As the Aztecs conquered
peoples from different language groups, this efficient pictorial system
made it possible for the educated to read documents without having a
common spoken language.</p>

<p>Wisdom was considered to reside in the accumulated knowledge
of the educated nobility and priests and was thought to be best
expressed orally through eloquent speeches learned in schools for the
nobility (<em>calmecac</em>). Sixteenth-century eye-witness
accounts tell us that the books were &ldquo;performed&rdquo;
(recited or sung) to convey their wealth of knowledge and meaning.</p>

<p>The Spanish Franciscan friar, Father Motolin&iacute;a,
described five types of preconquest books, all written in pictures and
symbols: histories; ceremonies; and three types of divinatory calendars
used to determine the future, to name children, and to indicate the
most propitious times for rites and ceremonies. There were three
formats for books and painted knowledge: the screenfold (a long strip
of native bark paper [<em>amatl</em>] folded accordion
style), the <em>tira</em> (an unfolded long strip of
paper), and the <em>lienzo</em> (a large single sheet
usually of cloth) on which the images were painted. No undisputed
preconquest Aztec documents survive, although there are a large number
of indigenous pictorial documents from the colonial period.</p>

<p>A screenfold manuscript on <em>amatl</em> (bark
paper), the <em>Codex Borbonicus</em> is a divinatory
almanac (<em>tonalamatl</em>/day book) used to divine the
future for both practical and ritual purposes. Each page represents a
thirteen-day &ldquo;week&rdquo; in a 260 day calendar; the
ruling deities and symbols associated with the week are prominently
displayed. In the boxes along the edge of each page, the named and
numbered days (1 to 13 dots) of the week are accompanied by their
governing supernaturals (birds and deities). A masterpiece of Aztec
style, the <em>Borbonicus</em> is believed to have been
made after the arrival of the Spanish. Note the Spanish words
identifying the pictorial text of numbered days.</p>
