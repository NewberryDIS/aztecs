Pietro Martire d'Anghiera
<br>
De Orbe Nouo Decades
<br>
Alcal&aacute; de Henares, Spain: Miguel de Egu&iacute;a, 1530
</p>


<p>In 1522, the Italian humanist Pietro Martire d&rsquo;Anghiera
invited Juan de Ribera, Cort&eacute;s's envoy from Mexico, to a
gathering at his home. Meeting with a group of politically connected
men from the Vatican, Venice, and Milan, Ribera answered questions
about the indigenous civilization and showed them jewelry, crafts,
clothing, maps, and other pictorial manuscripts. An Indian youngster
demonstrated indigenous customs, performing military combat and courtly
dances, and demonstrating ritual inebriation.</p>


<p>In 1530, d'Anghiera published De Orbe Nouo Decades. Based on
Ribera&rsquo;s report, the examination of indigenous items, and the
Nahua boy&rsquo;s performance, the book was the first serious depiction
of Aztec civilization presented to European audiences.</p>


<p class="caps">TRANSLATION OF TRANSCRIPT FROM DE ORBE NOUO DECADES [ABOVE]</p>


<p>Among the maps of their land, we truly examined one that was thirty
feet long, a little smaller in width, made of white woven cotton, in
which all the plains with their provinces, both enemy and friendly to
Motecuhzoma, were extensively inscribed. It shows at the same time vast
mountains enclosing the plains all around and also the southern coasts,
from whose inhabitants we heard that there are islands close to those
shores where, as we said before, they grow great amounts of spices,
gold and gems.</p>


<p>In those hills the inhabitants' accounts say there are wild men,
shaggy as the furry bears of mountain dens and satisfied with filthy
foods born in the earth or game. After the larger map, we saw another a
little smaller, but with no less enthusiasm on our part, the very city
of Tenochtitlan with its temples and bridges and surrounding lakes
painted by indigenous hand. After this, [Ribera] had an indigenous
youngster equipped as a warrior, whom he brought as his servant, come
out from my room to the open terrace where we sat.</p>
