<h1 class="caps section section-4"><!--SECTION 4: -->The
Persistence of Nahua Culture</h1>

<p>Indigenous culture persisted throughout the colonial period
even as the Nahuas experienced deadly illnesses to which they had no
immunity; forced labor; taxation; conversion to an alien religion; and
the exploitation of their resources by the invaders and their
descendants. The retention of native leadership in Indian communities,
which generally remained intact, fostered a collective identity within
the community even as these changes occurred. Indigenous people
utilized the imported Spanish legal system and were aggressive
litigators. Spoken and written Nahuatl further strengthened cultural
community and continuity; pictorial forms of writing also persisted,
although their use diminished over time.</p>

<p>Many documents that survive from this period speak of
families, inheritance, disputes, and the property rights of women. Maps
focus on litigation by indigenous communities defending their farming
property from destructive livestock and unscrupulous land grabs, and
reasserting their rights to diverted water sources. Other documents
deal with land disputes between indigenous communities. Marriage,
death, and taxation are represented, as are native
historians&rsquo; accounts of their history, ancestry, religion,
and the assertion of land rights based on ancient memory and
contemporary land needs.</p>

<h3 class="caps"><!--GROUP TEXT: -->Wills
and family disputes</h3>

<p>At least half of all existing colonial Nahua documents (both
pictorial and alphabetic) are wills bequeathing property and
possessions to heirs. The pictorial wills of Don Miguel
Dami&aacute;n show two different ways in which documents of this
kind were drawn up. Then, as now, there were also legal disputes
regarding the disposition of family property as in the litigation
between Juliana Tlaco and her daughter-in-law Pedronilla Francisca
Tenuch. In addition to the three pictorial documents in the
Newberry&rsquo;s collection, two alphabetic documents have also
survived (Archivo General de la Naci&oacute;n, Mexico). All of the
families represented were from the district of Xochimilco, on the
outskirts of Mexico City.</p>

Speech scrolls indicate the chief characters and darkened faces

<p>This map probably accompanied recorded litigation between

Irrigation ditches (<em>asequias</em>) feature prominently
in this map in which the lower third is &ldquo;Indian

<h3 class="caps"><!--GROUP TEXT: -->Eighteenth
century land documents</h3>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, deadly epidemics
and the forced concentration of scattered indigenous populations (<em>congregaci&oacute;n</em>)
created so-called &ldquo;empty&rdquo; lands. Consequent
challenges to land ownership in the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries necessitated the legalization of land titles (<em>composici&oacute;n</em>)
from ca. 1650-1750. In response to this challenge, indigenous
communities had titles made to document their ownership of the land.
Meant to be used as legal documents, these land documents are written
in Nahuatl and have extensive painted images which refer to ancient
ancestral ownership of the lands in question. The so-called Techialoyan
group of these documents from the Valley of Mexico are noted for their
use of rough <em>amatl</em> and an archaic Nahuatl
literary style.</p>

Pyramid of the Moon; an inverted green Pyramid of the Sun is at the
center of the Street. After Teotihuacan's collapse (ca. 650),
indigenous people continued to live in the pyramids' shadow. Explicit
references to the past through pictographs, Nahuatl, and men in ancient
dress were used to create an increased aura of validity and credibility

<h3 class="caps"><!--GROUP TEXT: -->Cochineal</h3>

<p>Cochineal is a brilliant crimson or chili-red dye produced
from the cochineal insect&mdash;Europeans initially thought the
insects were seeds (<em>grana</em>). The Aztecs, who
cultivated the insects on nopal cactus paddles, used the dye for
coloring cloth and painting books. During the colonial period,
cochineal became a source of great wealth as European demand for
cochineal-dyed cloth flourished. The Spanish retained a monopoly on the
dye until the late eighteenth century when the insects were smuggled
out of Mexico. Cochineal is commonly used today as a dye in food and
cosmetics.</p>

<p>This compilation of reports regarding New Spain and Peru
includes a description of the cultivation and preparation of cochineal.
Here, two indigenous people harvest the cochineal insects from the
paddles of a huge nopal cactus, scraping them into special bowls. Both
wear clothing with crimson stripes and accents. The woman is dressed in
an indigenous tunic (<em>huipil</em>) and kneels in
traditional fashion.</p>

<p>In this book, twelve large watercolor scenes illustrate the
annual cycle of planting, cultivating, and harvesting the nopal cactus.
In March and April, the cochineal insects are placed on the new cactus
plants to develop; in August and September they are harvested. The
cycle begins anew with the pruning and replanting of the nopals in
December. The temple-like building at the top of both scenes alludes to
the indigenous antiquity of cochineal cultivation.</p>

Francisco L&oacute;pez de G&oacute;mara&rsquo;s <em>Conquista

<p>This Nahuatl play based on the biblical story of Abraham and
the sacrifice of Isaac explored a traditional theme of Christian sacred
history for a Nahua speaking audience. The theme of obedience to God is
demonstrated first through Isaac&rsquo;s submission to his father
and then by Abraham&rsquo;s willingness to sacrifice his son at
God&rsquo;s request. Though not the main theme of the play, the
subject of human sacrifice likely played an important role in reminding
an indigenous audience to accept the Christian covenant in the terms
established through divine law. More importantly, through performance,
this play displays appropriate ways for a Nahua to address God and to
behave obediently to one&rsquo;s parents as well as to
God&rsquo;s commandments. </p>

<p>In the late 1880&rsquo;s, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a
Lizaula assembled a series of documents dating from 1531 to 1885 to
support his claim to the pension granted in 1590 by King Philip II to
the direct descendants of the Emperor Motecuhzuma Xocoyotzin. Among his
documents, Lizaula included a copy of a genealogy of Motecuhzoma said
to have been made in the sixteenth century and a poignant,
nineteenth-century engraving of the Emperor Motecuhzoma. Lizaula's
claim was ultimately dismissed by the Mexican Supreme Court and
Treasury Department.</p>
