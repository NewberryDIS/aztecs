<img class="rotating-image" src="images/exhibit_front.jpg">
<p>This virtual exhibition is based on <em>The Aztecs and
the Making of Colonial Mexico</em>,
a display of original manuscripts, books, and other materials at the
Newberry Library from September 28, 2006 through January 13, 2007.
Ellen T. Baird and Cristi&aacute;n Roa-de-la-Carrera, both of the
University of Illinois at Chicago, curated the exhibit. The virtual
exhibit includes the complete text from the original gallery exhibit
and digitized images of many of the manuscripts and books that were
displayed.</p>

<p>The Aztecs are well-known as the people who established the
great
city Tenochtitlan (ca. 1325; present-day Mexico City) and conquered and
ruled Mexico from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf Coast. The Spanish
conquistador Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s's invasion and
conquest of the
Aztec empire in 1521 had profound consequences for Mexico's indigenous
people.</p>

<p>This exhibition focuses on Colonial Mexico and the
intersection and
interaction between a Spanish culture of written knowledge and an Aztec
culture of oral knowledge and pictorial writing. How did the Aztecs'
descendants, the Nahua, respond to the challenge of an alien people,
culture, language, and religious beliefs? How did the Nahua preserve
their culture, language, identity and history? How did they shape the
colonial era?</p>

<p>Drawing upon the Newberry Library's remarkable Mexican
holdings,
this exhibition presents a wide range of religious, historical, and
legal documents (including manuscripts, maps, and printed books)
produced by, for, and about the Nahua. These documents tell many
stories&mdash;of Spanish friars learning Nahuatl, the language of
the
Nahua, to convert indigenous people to Christianity; of property passed
to generations of descendants; of legal battles to retain land
ownership and use; of continued and intermingled traditions; and the
lives of people who are the ancestors of the Mexicans of today. These
stories speak eloquently, and beautifully, of the richness and vigor of
indigenous creativity and intellectual production in the colonial
period: they highlight the dynamic vitality and resilience of the Nahua
descendants of the Aztec throughout the colonial period and beyond.</p>

<p>The Newberry Library is an independent research library, open
to the
public without charge. It was established in Chicago in 1887 by a
bequest of Walter L. Newberry (1804-1868). The core of the
Library&rsquo;s Mexicana holdings were donated in 1911 by trustee
Edward E. Ayer (1841-1927).</p>

<p>The Library&rsquo;s mission is to advance and disseminate
knowledge,
and to that end it acquires and preserves humanities research materials
related primarily to the histories and cultures of western Europe and
the Americas. To promote the effective use of all its collections, the
Newberry fosters research, teaching, publication, life-long learning,
and civic engagement in an atmosphere of free intellectual inquiry.
This virtual exhibit is an expression of the Library&rsquo;s
mission.</p>

<h1 class="caps section section-0">Acknowledgments</h1>

<p><em>The Aztecs and the Making of Colonial Mexico</em>
grew out of my
lifelong fascination with Mexico and its people: the mighty Aztecs
whose empire stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific, and the
colonial Nahua (the Aztec descendants) who survived despite the
depredations they suffered. As a scholar, my research has focused on
the intersection of indigenous and European culture after the Spanish
invasion, as represented in early colonial manuscripts. These documents
provide a remarkable visual narrative of Nahua cultural resilience,
tenacity, and indomitable strength in the face of almost unimaginable
challenges and devastation. As distinguished scholar Louise Burkhart
has noted: "It is they [the colonial Nahua] who faced the greatest
challenge ever presented to Nahua culture&mdash;how to make sense
of an
invasion by alien beings intent not only on seizing their wealth and
territory but on altering their most deeply held religious beliefs.
That they survived with a large part of their cultural identity intact
is perhaps a more impressive achievement than the feats of the
poet-kings, warriors, and scribes so beloved of pre-Conquest
enthusiasts."</p>

<p><em>The Aztecs and the Making of Colonial Mexico</em>
was a venue
for examining the influence of the Nahuas on Spanish colonialism in
Mexico. The ability of Nahua communities to adapt and refashion
themselves in response to the Spanish invasion, to create a space for
their knowledge and ideas against the grain of colonization, to infuse
a dazzling vitality into their endeavors, and ultimately to shape the
world in which they lived was certainly the lure that brought me to the
books and documents that so eloquently reveal these stories. My
research has focused on the study of the ways in which Spanish
colonization has transformed culture. Examining the cultural production
of peoples capable of flourishing under these oppressive conditions was
a unique opportunity to appreciate the resilience of their culture and
to reflect on the insights that their experiences can bring into our
world.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Catherine Burdick who researched and wrote
the
exhibition text for Contemporary Expressions of Nahua Culture and for
her assistance in curating the exhibition. Special thanks also go to
Michel Oudijk, Mar&iacute;a Casta&ntilde;eda de la Paz, and
Leonardo
L&oacute;pez L&uacute;jan for sharing unpublished research.
Their
generosity was absolutely essential in untangling the Xochimilco wills
and the Teotihuacan (San Francisco Mazapan) map. We would also like to
thank the following scholars, without whose research and enlightening
scholarship the exhibition text could not have been written: Elizabeth
H. Boone; Louise M. Burkhart; Mary L. Clayton; Inga Clendinnen;
Dav&iacute;d Carrasco; Janine Gasco; John Glass; Jorge Klor de
Alva;

Barbara
Mundy; Anthony Pagden; Jeanette F. Peterson; Jos&eacute; Rabasa,
Donald
Robertson; Alan R. Sandstrom; Pamela Effrein Sandstrom; Susan
Schroeder; John Frederik Schwaller; and Stephanie Wood. Thanks also to
Benjamin Johnson who translated Nahuatl texts for us and last, but not
least, to Thomas Cummins who first suggested an exhibit on the rich
contributions of the Francisans and the Nahua in colonial Mexico.</p>

<p>The Newberry Library&rsquo;s outstanding collection of
Mexicana
(primarily the Edward E. Ayer Collection) afforded us the opportunity
to delve deeply into the rich heritage of indigenous people in colonial
Mexico. We also want to express our deep appreciation to the Newberry
staff who closely worked with us on the exhibit for their extraordinary
efforts and support: James Grossman, Vice President for Research and
Education; Riva Feshbach, Exhibits Manager; Chester Design Associates;
Rachel Bohlmann, Director of Public Programs; Mary Janzen Quinn,
Manager of Public Programming; Heather Malec, Director of Public
Relations and Communications; Kimberly Zingale, Graphic Designer;
Kimberly Ball, Associate Director of Development for Corporate and
Foundation Relations; and John Aubrey, Ayer Librarian.</p>

<p>We also want to acknowledge the generous financial support for
the
exhibit provided by the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s
Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Arts, Architecture, and
Humanities Project Awards and the Department of Art History.</p>

<p>The Newberry Library holds in trust for research use original
books,
images, manuscripts, and documents that illuminate the roots of Mexico
and its people. Without three bridge builders from Chicago&rsquo;s
Mexican American community who served as advisors in the early stage of
this project, these important historical records would continue to
remain largely unknown to this diverse and growing population. </p>

<p>Hector Hernandez, director of Pilsen&rsquo;s Rudy Lozano
branch of
the Chicago Public Library, has always been a hospitable and supportive
colleague. Rita Arias Jirasek, consultant, educator, and independent
scholar, immediately saw the value of this project, and spread the word
among members of the community with passionate enthusiasm. Rita also
encouraged us to reach out to underserved South Chicago neighborhoods
and suburbs, where schools, libraries, and individuals have welcomed
new historical knowledge about the Aztecs and Nahua Finally, Carlos
Tortolero, President of the National Museum of Mexican Art, challenged
us to build bridges across the international border by bringing Nahua
guests from Mexico to Chicago to demonstrate in person how vital Nahua
people and culture are in Mexico today.</p>
