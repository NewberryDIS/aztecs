<h1 class="caps section section-2"><!--SECTION 2: -->Europeans
Invade the Aztec Empire</h1>

<p>Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s and his company reached
the island of San Juan de Ul&uacute;a on the coast of the Aztec
province of Cuetlaxtlan (Veracruz) on April 20, 1519. Soon after, the
Spaniards began exchanging messages with the ruler Motecuhzoma
Xocoyotzin in Mexico-Tenochtitlan. From his interpreters,
Jer&oacute;nimo de Aguilar and Malintzin Tenepal, Cort&eacute;s
gained valuable information about the politics of the region, which he
used to establish key political alliances necessary for achieving his
goals. Language and knowledge thus became central to Spanish
empire-building efforts in the lands dominated by the Aztecs.</p>

<p>Reports, maps, and specimens of all kinds were promptly
dispatched to Spain along with the treasure collected by the
conquistadors. For the Spaniards, the power to define the indigenous
people&mdash;new subjects of the crown&mdash;equaled the right
to rule them. The Nahuas too quickly understood that even their history
and identity was itself a prized booty for the Spaniards.</p>

<p>In his letters to the Hapsburg Emperor Charles V, King of
Spain, Spanish conquistador Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s
trumpeted his exploits, and described the people and wonders of the new
land he had conquered. This map, published with
Cort&eacute;s&rsquo;s letters, provided Europeans with the
first image of the Aztec capital city, Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>Although in ruins at the time of the map&rsquo;s
publication, the island city, with the Aztec sacred ceremonial district
at its heart, appears serene and orderly under the double eagle and
crown of the Hapsburg imperial flag. The smaller map to the left

<p>Describing the last stages of the indigenous resistance in
Tenochtitlan, Cort&eacute;s confronted the human tragedy of the
conquest. The conquistador was never able to predict or understand the
Aztecs&rsquo; willingness to withstand misery, starvation, and
massive deaths rather than surrender. Neither words nor the force of
arms served him to persuade Cuauht&eacute;moc, the last Aztec
ruler, to submit to Spanish authority. How the world of the Indians was
different from his was a question beyond his grasp.</p>

<h3>Translation of transcription from <em>Carta tercera de
relaci&oacute;n</em>:</h3>

<p>I welcomed him openly, so that he should not be afraid; but at
last he told me that his sovereign would prefer to die where he was
rather than on any account appear before me. . . . The people of the
city had to walk upon their dead while others swam or drowned in the
waters of that wide lake where they had their canoes; indeed, so great
was their suffering that it was beyond our understanding how they could
endure it. Countless numbers of men, women and children came out toward
us, and in their eagerness to escape many were pushed into the water
where they drowned amid that multitude of corpses; and it seemed that
more than fifty thousand had perished from the salt water they had
drunk, their hunger and the vile stench. So that we should not discover
the plight which they were in, they dared neither throw these bodies
into the water where the brigantines might find them nor throw them
beyond their boundaries where the soldiers might see them; and so in
those streets where they were, they came across such piles of the dead
that we were forced to walk upon them (Cort&eacute;s,
Hern&aacute;n. <em>Letters from Mexico</em>. Edited by

<p>In 1522, the Italian humanist Pietro Martire
d&rsquo;Anghiera invited Juan de Ribera, Cort&eacute;s's envoy
from Mexico, to a gathering at his home. Meeting with a group of
politically connected men from the Vatican, Venice, and Milan, Ribera
answered questions about the indigenous civilization and showed them
jewelry, crafts, clothing, maps, and other pictorial manuscripts. An
Indian youngster demonstrated indigenous customs, performing military
combat and courtly dances, and demonstrating ritual inebriation.</p>

<p>In 1530, d'Anghiera published <em>De Orbe Nouo Decades</em>.
Based on Ribera&rsquo;s report, the examination of indigenous
items, and the Nahua boy&rsquo;s performance, the book was the
first serious depiction of Aztec civilization presented to European
audiences.</p>

<h3>Translation of Transcript from <em>De Orbe Nouo Decades</em>:</h3>

<p>Among the maps of their land, we truly examined one that was
thirty feet long, a little smaller in width, made of white woven
cotton, in which all the plains with their provinces, both enemy and
friendly to Motecuhzoma, were extensively inscribed. It shows at the
same time vast mountains enclosing the plains all around and also the
southern coasts, from whose inhabitants we heard that there are islands
close to those shores where, as we said before, they grow great amounts
of spices, gold and gems.</p>

<p>In those hills the inhabitants' accounts say there are wild
men, shaggy as the furry bears of mountain dens and satisfied with
filthy foods born in the earth or game. After the larger map, we saw
another a little smaller, but with no less enthusiasm on our part, the
very city of Tenochtitlan with its temples and bridges and surrounding
lakes painted by indigenous hand. After this, [Ribera] had an
indigenous youngster equipped as a warrior, whom he brought as his
servant, come out from my room to the open terrace where we sat.</p>

<p>One of the most important sources on the Spanish conquest is
Francisco L&oacute;pez de G&oacute;mara&rsquo;s <em>Historia
general de las Indias</em>, the second section of which includes
a detailed picture of indigenous culture and society in Mexico.
G&oacute;mara worked with a wealth of sources, from previous
accounts of the conquest to detailed studies of indigenous religion by
missionaries in the field. Like most of his contemporaries,
G&oacute;mara had difficulty grasping the breadth of indigenous
learning. The various means of transmitting this knowledge were equally
opaque to him.</p>

<p>Long after the conquest, the conquistadors continued to be
haunted by their initial impressions of Tenochtitlan. As the Spaniards
described their panoramic view of the city, this image evoked
admiration, fear, and a desire to control the unknown.</p>

<p>Caught up in demands for grants and privileges, Bernal
D&iacute;az recalled the imposing image of the city from the Great
Temple to justify the conquistadors&rsquo; violation of indigenous
sovereignty. He described Motecuhzoma and Cort&eacute;s, hands

abandon their traditional religious practices. Indians themselves
embraced the European notion of the Devil and even used it ingeniously
to challenge the imported religion.</p>
