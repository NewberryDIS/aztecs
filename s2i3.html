<p>Describing the last stages of the indigenous resistance in
Tenochtitlan, Cort&eacute;s confronted the human tragedy of the
conquest. The conquistador was never able to predict or understand the
Aztecs&rsquo; willingness to withstand misery, starvation, and massive
deaths rather than surrender. Neither words nor the force of arms
served him to persuade Cuauht&eacute;moc, the last Aztec ruler, to
submit to Spanish authority. How the world of the Indians was different
from his was a question beyond his grasp.</p>


<p class="caps">Translation of transcription from Carta tercera de relaci&oacute;n:</p>


<p>I welcomed him openly, so that he should not be afraid; but at last
he told me that his sovereign would prefer to die where he was rather
than on any account appear before me. . . . The people of the city had
to walk upon their dead while others swam or drowned in the waters of
that wide lake where they had their canoes; indeed, so great was their
suffering that it was beyond our understanding how they could endure
it. Countless numbers of men, women and children came out toward us,
and in their eagerness to escape many were pushed into the water where
they drowned amid that multitude of corpses; and it seemed that more
than fifty thousand had perished from the salt water they had drunk,
their hunger and the vile stench. So that we should not discover the
plight which they were in, they dared neither throw these bodies into
the water where the brigantines might find them nor throw them beyond
their boundaries where the soldiers might see them; and so in those
streets where they were, they came across such piles of the dead that
we were forced to walk upon them (Translation by Anthony Pagden,
Letters from Mexico, pp. 263-264)</p>
